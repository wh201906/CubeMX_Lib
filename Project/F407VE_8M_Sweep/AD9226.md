~~Data will change after a posedge~~  
~~The output delay time(from posedge to data change) is 3.5ns~7ns~~  
~~For STM32F407@168MHz, the AHB1 Bus speed is 168MHz->5.95238ns per cycle~~  
~~t_S is the DMA service time for per requested single data,~~  
~~t_S = t_A + t_RD + t_WR~~  
~~t_A_min is 2 AHB clock cycles, t_A will be longer if there is higher priority channel with a pending request, or the slave is not ready.~~  
~~t_RD_min is 2 AHB clock cycles, t_RD will be longer in case of bus sharing.~~  
~~GPIO might be accessed at 11.90476ns~29.76190ns after the edge(2~5 cycle)~~  
~~When operating AD9280 at 65M, t_pulse is 7.692ns~~  
~~When operating AD9280 at 21M, t_pulse is 23.810ns, sample after posedge or negedge~~  
~~When operating AD9280 at 14M, t_pulse is 35.714ns, sample after posedge or negedge, sample after posedge with 2 AD9226~~  

Doesn't work as expected......
